# CLI-weather-App
This is my first Respiratory ☺️
Happy learning Python 🤗💞

Time to write a Python weather app and dream of distant places right from your CLI!

You’ll get the current weather data by city name from different locations around the world, using the weather API from OpenWeather. This application programming interface (API) is free to use, with a generous quota of API calls. However, you’ll need to create a personal API key to make requests, which you can do in just a moment.
